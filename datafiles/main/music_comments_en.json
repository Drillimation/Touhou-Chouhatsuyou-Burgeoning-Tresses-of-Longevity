            "Title screen theme.\n\nIt's the same usual song. Imagine the Youkai Mountain but with the season inverted from autumn to spring. Because autumn-sounding tunes are so dark in their own right, I made this one a little brighter and playful.",
            "Stage 1 theme.\n\nI envision this theme playing on the first day of spring, but depending on how north you live, you may still see snow on the ground, or maybe even an extended winter.\nI wanted this theme to fit an open and wide area. I sort of envisioned it as a spring version of A God That Misses People ~ Romantic Fall from Mountain of Faith.\nInterestingly, this song was composed in late winter. (^^;)",
            "Mayu Ikazuchi's theme.\n\nI took on a different approach compared to most other Touhou fangame boss themes. I went for an orchestral feel on this one, which is something that no other game has ever touched upon.\nIt may be weird to have a character resembling an idol conducting an orchestra, but she attacks when any person smiles at her.",
            "Stage 2 theme.\n\nThe last game had a water stage for stage 2, and I did it again for this one. The Bamboo Forest of the Lost had part of the Sanzu River cross through it. I'm not sure how I mixed the two locations, and how it sound a little romantic. Well, I originally composed this as a Valentine's Day theme, and you tend to waltz on water.\nI think forests are the wrong place where love can happen.",
            "Kisumi Torisawa's theme.\n\nThis is a theme I originally composed for The Struggle of the Mollusk. Have you encountered a mermaid with super long hair? In art, yes, but in real life, good luck. (^^;)\nKisumi is one of them, and she appears in a river, which is unusual. Where else might you find sirens? Somebody put one in a well, or a pond outside the Palace of Eternity. (^^;)",
            "Stage 3 theme.\n\nThis is another theme originally composed for The Struggle of the Mollusk. Despite taking place in the Palace of Eternity, this theme is more Chinese than Japanese. That's because it was composed to welcome the Year of the Rabbit on the Chinese zodiac, and the Inaba sisters happen to live in the Palace of Eternity.\nThe two Mythos of Phantasmagoria games have seen the theme expanded in some form, and this is the ultimate one.",
            "Kiyomi Tatariya's theme.\n\nEmiko Hosokawa envisioned Kiyomi as an oriental concert conductor. I originally wanted to make it orchestral like Mayu's theme but I dropped it and she received a traditional Touhou-style theme.\nThere are no other characters that are conductors other than Wonderful Waking World's Reverence, so I think Kiyomi is the second one. (^^;)",
            "Stage 4 theme.\n\nI arranged this theme from the Hifuu album of the same name. This theme is meant to be the \"prelude\" of a festive event that takes place in a tower. They're narrow, so I don't know how you can host a big event inside.\nSuika is said to be the master of fests, but I don't designate this as a secondary theme for her.",
            "Asta Nattendottir's theme.\n\nThis is another theme arranged from Prelude of a Joyous Feast. I arranged Unknown Fate of the Hifuu Club, but expanded it. Despite going by a different name, Hosokawa wouldn't be amused that this was an arrangement of a theme I did.\nThe character is a gothic lolita, so I needed something dark other than the previous theme for something sweet.",
            "Stage 5 theme.\n\nThis is also another arrangement from Prelude of a Joyous Feast. You've made it inside Dragon's Tower, and as with other games that are set in a tower, there is always someone ready to curse you at the top. Hosokawa wanted me to put Kiyomi in for the mid-boss. I thought it was a good idea as I had no idea who to put when I conceived the stage.\nThe real curse would lie beyond her...",
            "Mabayu Kanbe's theme.\n\nIf you write a song with a 3/4 or 6/4 time measure, does it make it more fun? It still carries the same level of waltzing since Mabayu is a dancer.\nSo far, Touhou has had no characters with a mother-daughter relationship. That is if you count the various fanworks with similar themes.\nI originally wanted to adapt the album featuring a tengu goddess, but my plans ultimately transformed into this game after she fired her distorted arrows at me.",
            "Final stage theme.\n\nThis is just an arrange of the title screen theme, but with a faster take.\nBasically, you are rushing up to the top of a tower that contains the final boss.\nI've written similar tower themes in other games, particularly the first Mythos of Phantasmagoria, but never in this scale.",
            "Yuugiku Kanbe's theme.\n\nYuugiku Kanbe is a crazy strong woman with very long hair, and she released the scent that caused every girl's hair to grow all the way down to the ground, even her own daughter.\nEven though Yuugiku is ethnically Chinese and didn't adopt her Japanese name until her marriage, I didn't use any oriental instruments, nor make it sound like that.\nHer tribal treasure is her hair. It's difficult to name the instruments that describe it.",
            "Extra stage theme.\n\nOn April 8, 2024, I got to witness a spectacular event in my hometown: a total solar eclipse.\nA Nephilim was the basis for this song. I based the entire song from the moment the moon begins to cover the sun and the point of totality. This is when the tone of the song shifts midway.\nIn the past, people viewed eclipses as a threat, but today they're a heavenly event.",
            "Yuugiku Kanbe's theme.\n\nWait, did I already compose a theme for this character? Who told me about a second theme for her?\nThere have been instances of the final boss of a Touhou game reappearing as the extra stage boss. Okina may have done it once.\nAnyway, Yuugiku is ashamed that she lost all her hair to you. I decided to really explain her Chinese roots in this theme, so I added a yangqin as one of the instruments. There's nothing else oriental to explain.",
            "Ending theme.\n\nI first composed this on the YM3812 chip for the second Mythos of Phantasmagoria game before arranging it for this game. Omens intend to foreshadow something, usually the events of the extra stage.\nAgain, this may be another orchestral-sounding piece that uses classical instruments.",
            "Staff roll theme.\n\nHair loss is a big deal for girls and women because long hair is a feminine trait and takes a long time to grow. This is especially true if they are left bald in the case of alopecia.\nIn many religions, it may be part of a rite of passage or character development.\nThere is only one conclusion that Yuugiku and Mabayu may answer. When you defeated them, they threw those lost locks from the tower into the sky and flowed away in the Sanzu River.",
            "Name entry theme.\n\nI still arranged the same song from the previous game, but implemented the tengu goddess' motif. The Yao Queen and Okiku Princess may have taken over her throne, but Flandre's minions may come in one day..."
